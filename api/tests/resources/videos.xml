Since this channel’s inception, we have examined several encounters with strange entities, which took place in remote North American communities. In many of these cases, the bizarre nature of the incident has gone on to immortalise not only the being itself but also the location in which it was seen. In this episode, we will be exploring one of America’s most infamous encounters. Join us as we recount the tale of the Flatwoods Monster.

From ghostly sightings, weird time slips and bizarre reality glitches, Liverpool it seems, has something of an obscure history of strange occurrences. But an incident in 1961, which saw multiple witnesses incapacitated by strange figures, would add the possibility of inter-dimensional gateways to the city’s ever-growing list of unusual happenings. Join us as we explore the Wavertree bus incident.
